The OBIS code identifies the corresponding device value. It is a text string
composed according to the OBIS standard.
Older and simpler variant is the EDIS code. This code does not cover the groups
A and B (read further).
This code is used in te PROMOTIC system by the PmIEC62056 driver.
The driver, after receiving the "Values Readout" type message, saves the large
text string into the "ResultList" variable. The OBIS value code is located at
the beginning of each row in the string.

The code consists of (up to) 6 group sub-identifiers marked by letters A to F.
All these may or may not be present in the identifier (e.g. groups A and B are
often omitted). In order to decide to which group the sub-identifier belongs,
the groups are separated by unique separators:
A-B:C.D.E*F
- The A group defines the medium (0=abstract objects, 1=electricity, 6=heat,
  7=gas, 8=water, ...)
- The B group defines the channel. Each device with multiple channels
  generating measurement results, can separate the results into the channels.
- The C group defines the physical value (current, voltage, energy, level,
  temperature, ...)
- The D group defines the quantity computation output of specific algorythm
- The E group specifies the measurement type defined by groups A to D into
  individual measurements (e.g. switching ranges)
- The F group separates the results partly defined by groups A to E.
  The typical usage is the specification of individual time ranges.
